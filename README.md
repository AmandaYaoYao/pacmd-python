# pacmd-python  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/avindra/pacmd-python/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/avindra/pacmd-python)

Python bindings to `pacmd`. This transforms the semi-structured output from `pacmd` into dictionaries.

# Why

In my research, programming with `Pulseaudio` generally requires strictly using the C bindings, which aren't easily scriptable. `Python` is a great fit for general purpose scripting.

# Usage

TBD. Probably as a published package. For now, read the tests and copy the code.

# Contributing

If you find this useful, I will gladly review PRs to help improve this project.
